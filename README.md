## Site Map

The information architecture was organized in such a way as to ensure that users can navigate through the site easily.
![Site Map](docs/images/site_map/site-map.png)

## Structure

### Code structure

The project is organized into various applications, as constructed using the Django Framework. App details are as follows:

- **Bag** - this app is for users where they can view, add and remove products that they have added to the bag.
- **Checkout** - this app is for users to purchase selected items. Users can see items in the cart and have the option to save delivery information to their profile during the checkout process.
- **Contact** - this app is for users to be able to contact MX Monster and recieve acknowledgment.
- **FAQ** - this app is for the business owner to manage content of the frequently asked questions page from the admin panel.
- **Home** - this app contains information about the MX Monster home page with quick links in the header.
- **Newsletter** - this app is for users to subscribe to or unsubscribe from a newsletter.
- **Products** - this app contains information related to the products displayed on the website. Users can add items to a shopping cart, filter for items in categories, and view the results of the product search. Clicking on individual items opens a sub-page where users can see detailed product information. The logged-in staff members have the following options:
  - add a new product for sale,
  - update an existing product,
  - delete product that is no longer for sale
- **Profiles** - this app contains information related to the user profiles.
- **Reviews** - this app is for users to add their reviews related to the products. Logged-in users can edit or delete their own reviews. The business owner can manage reviews posted by the shoppers in the admin panel.
- **Staff** - this app is for the business owner to manage MX Monster staff in the admin panel. Thanks to this app information about the staff members is dynamically displayed on the page. Information about the team is pulled from the database; it is not hard-coded in HTML.

To complement the apps there are:

- **Mx Monster**: Mx Monster level files - settings.py for project level settings and urls.py to route the website urls.
- **Templates**: Containing the base.html, allauth(django authentication). The partial folder contains the navbar and footer HTML.
- **Templates** (app level): some of the apps have their own templates directory for HTML to consider portability and reuse.
- **Urls (app level)**: each app has its own urls.py file to consider portability and reuse.
- **Static**: CSS files for the website and admin panel.
- **manage.py**: This file is used to start the site and perform functions during development.
- **README.md**: Documentation about the project.
- **Requirements.txt**: Containing the project dependencies. Note: Environment variable values are not exposed in the source code as they are stored locally in env.py that is not checked in(listed in .gitignore).
- **Procfile**: To run the application on Heroku
- **custom_storages.py** file - to specify static and media storage location

### Database design

## Design Choices

### Home page background

As the background of the main page, I used a photo of a motorcycle with proper accessories and a motorcyclist wearing clothing. The photo represents the store's theme nicely, in my opinion.

![Home page](docs/images/existing_features/home_page/home-page.JPG)

### Fonts

I visited the Google fonts website to explore the available font options for my project. After consideration, three different font types were chosen to be used in different sections of the website.

- The [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton?query=anton) font is used in the navigation bar and to display the business name.
- The [Michroma](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Michroma?query=michroma) font is used to display text information in the footer links.
- The [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round?query=varela) font is used to display all other text information.

### Colours

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to come up with a color scheme. The color palette was intended to create a fairly neutral background so that the photos of the products stand out as much as possible.

- gradient (#f30606, #b12020, #030303) - the business name displayed on the navigation bar
- #f1f1f1 - the website background color
- #ffffff - the cards background color
- #212529 - footer and free delivery banner background color
- #b31212 - hover effect color
- #ffac0c - text color on the business opening times card
- #FFC107 - text color displayed on the home page carousel

![Colors](docs/images/colors/website_colors.JPG)

### Icons

All the icons that are used in this project come from the [Font Awsome](https://fontawesome.com/) website.

### Search

![Search](docs/images/icons/search_icon.jpg)

### My account

### Bag shopping cart

## Features

### Responsive design

The website has been designed using Bootstrap 4 therefore it's fully responsive on all screen sizes.

### Homepage

The home page is a simple set of navigation elements, a background image, and a carousel that displays shop now, contact and newsletter subscription options.

A shop now button directs the user to the “All products” page, where they can easily identify products they would like to purchase. The product list displayed on this page is always ordered by date added, i.e., the latest products added for sale by the shop admin will be displayed at the top of the page.

A contact button directs the user to the page with the contact form that is used to contact the customer service team in case of any queries that the customer may have.

A Subscribe button directs the user to the page where they can subscribe to the newsletter to receive information about new products, special offers, discounts, etc.

A Facebook button directs the user to the shop's Facebook page.

### Customized Admin (the business owner) panel

The admin panel was adjusted with the following changes:

- the name of the business is now displayed on the top bar
- the color scheme was slightly changed
- the color of some buttons was changed

The changes above are only cosmetic, but thanks to that, the panel looks a little bit different than the standard Django panel.

![MX Monster admin panel](docs/images/existing_features/admin-area/admin-panel.JPG)

The Django admin panel is a built-in tool that allows admin users to create, view, update, and delete records. This is a very useful tool to manipulate all the data tables in one place.
Some examples of how it can be used are shown below.

#### Admin panel - ability to select products that will be displayed on the page

This feature allows the business owner to enable or disable the product's visibility on the website. There is no need to delete the product from the database if, for some reason, the business owner does not want it to be displayed on the website (i.e., the product is sold out or temporarily unavailable).

![Product available for sale](docs/images/existing_features/admin-area/admin-panel-product-available-for-sale.JPG)

![Only two products selected for sale](docs/images/existing_features/admin-area/admin-panel-only-two-products-for-sale.JPG)

![Only two products displayed on the main page](docs/images/existing_features/admin-area/only-two-products-for-sale.JPG)

#### Admin panel - ability to add a new employee

The business owner can add a new employee via the admin panel. All the information about the staff(photo, name, email, etc.) that is displayed on the website(the About page) comes from the database, and it's not hard coded in HTML. Therefore, in the event of any changes(i.e. new employee), the updated information will be automatically displayed on the website.

![Add new employee](docs/images/existing_features/admin-area/add-new-employee.JPG)

#### Admin panel - ability to review orders

![Admin panel orders review](docs/images/existing_features/admin-area/admin-panel-orders-review.JPG)

#### Admin panel - ability to review messages sent by the customers

![Admin panel message review](docs/images/existing_features/admin-area/admin-panel-contact.JPG)

### Admin panel - ability to approve product reviews

The registeed user can add the product review, however it will be displayed on the page upon the businnes approval.
All new reviews are not published by default.

![Reviews not published](docs/images/existing_features/reviews/reviews-not-published.JPG)

![Reviews not published product page](docs/images/existing_features/reviews/reviews-not-published-product-page.JPG)

![Revies published](docs/images/existing_features/reviews/reviews-published.JPG)

![Reviews published product page](docs/images/existing_features/reviews/reviews-published-product-page.JPG)

## SEO - Search Engine Optimization

To improve the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the site the keywords were researched using [WordTracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/) to optimize web pages and content to increase ranking in search engines.
The keyword research was used for both short-tail & long-tail keywords.

![Search Engine Optimization](docs/images/seo/seo.JPG)

## Marketing

As part of marketing strategies for the MX Monster Store, I decided to use social media, and email marketing. All options are free, but effective for an e-commerce store.

### Facebook Business Page

- A Facebook business page was the chosen platform, to help build relationships and loyalty with customers. This can be achieved by posting frequent updates to the site, promoting the items, and having direct interactions with existing and potential customers. The next steps would include using Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube as social media platforms to target a larger audience.

Facebook site can be viewed [here](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088407152747)

### Email marketing(Newsletter)

- I've opted to create a custom newsletter model and not use Mailchimp. A newsletter is another free source of marketing, whereby by using email subscriptions, users would receive a newsletter, outlining current items in the store, sales, discounts, and any other information related to the business. This is a straightforward way to increase sales and have customers return by providing discounts.

Fix : Add if statement to check if the thumbnail image(s) exist in the database.

``` Django
{% if product.image_1 %}
<div class="col-md-2">
    <a href="{{ product.image_1.url }}" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="img-gallery"
        aria-label="Product photo 1" data-height="560" data-width="560">
        <img src="{{ product.image_1.url }}" alt="Product photo 1" class="img-fluid mb-1">
    </a>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

</details>

## Product quantity validation

During testing of the MX Monster Store functionality, I discovered a critical bug that allows the user to bypass the minimum and maximum values ​​when entering the product quantity that can be added to the basket. This could be done by removing or adjusting the min and max values.

![HTML code manipulation](docs/images/quantity_validation/html-code-manipulation.JPG)

After removing min and max values, I was able to enter negative product quantities as well as quantities that exceeded the product stock value.

![Negative product quantity added to the bag](docs/images/quantity_validation/quantity-negative-number-of-items-added-to-the-bag.JPG)

![Negative product quantity bag view](docs/images/quantity_validation/quantity-negative-number-of%20item-bag-view.JPG)

![Product quantity more that available in stock](docs/images/quantity_validation/quantity-more-than-available-in-stock-added-to-basket.JPG)

![Product quantity more that available added to the basket](docs/images/quantity_validation/quantity-more-than-available-in-stock-added-to-basket-confirmation.JPG)

![Product quantity more that available bag view](docs/images/quantity_validation/quantity-more-than-available-in-stock-added-to-basket-bag-view.JPG)

After the implementation of the product quantity validation, the relevant message will be displayed on the screen if the user enters a product quantity that exceeds the product stock.
Even if the HTML code is manipulated (max value), the product quantity validation will handle all exceptions.

![Product quantity error message](docs/images/quantity_validation/quantity-error-message.JPG)

The minimum value is set to "1" in the HTML code, so the user cannot enter a negative quantity.

![Negative product quantity product page](docs/images/quantity_validation/quantity-error-message-product-page.JPG)

However, if the HTML code is manipulated (the minimum value is deleted or changed), a relevant message will be displayed on the screen as the product quantity validation will handle this exception.

![Negative product quantity handeled by validation code](docs/images/quantity_validation/negative-quantity-error-message.JPG)
